## What's Done

- App bootstrapped with [Create React App].
- Added [React Bootstrap] library for basic UI components

## What's for Future

- Consider ejecting [Create React App] for greater control over Webpack configuration, linting, etc
- Ditch [React Bootstrap] and re-write UI components as a sepearate library
- Extra a theme into a separate library that can be applied to the application (e.g. styled-components)
- Update middleware to handle checking redux state for data before dispatch
- Fetching HOC to have reusable loader while data is being fetched
