## What's Done

- App bootstrapped with [Create React App].
- Added [React Bootstrap] library for basic UI components

## What's for Future

- Consider ejecting [Create React App] for greater control over Webpack configuration, linting, etc
- Rewrite UI components within the library folder as per design styleguide, rather than just exporting from [React Bootstrap]
